Dust Cyclone Design


- 2D2D cyclone, or AEC cyclones are almost 100% efficient for particles larger than 20um

- barrel and cone heights are equal to two barrel diameters. Shepherd and lapple design was of the same aspect ratio.

- higher gas flow, with higher pressure drop, yields an increase in efficiency.

- rough seams in cyclone body can reduce collection efficiency.


-1d3d cyclones with enhancements are now most common
- 1d3d refers to barrel height of one barrel diameter, and cone height of three barrel diameters.
- inlet is ½ diameter high, ¼ diameter wide. 
- cone bottom is 1/3 diameter wide with an expansion chamber
